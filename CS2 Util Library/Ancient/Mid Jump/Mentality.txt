If you want to hit this jump, you need to be completely locked in focused on the white line leaving the bottom of your screen.

When locked in you can hit it 70+ percent of the time.
If you are locked in and strafe correctly you should hit it almost every time.
You dont actually need to airstrafe hard, just jump late and hit the corner well.

Its better to jump too late so you dont float in the air, and can go donut.

Accuracy of finding the corner to land on is THE most important component, after jumping late
